# 📊 Student Lifestyle EDA

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student lifestyle dataset to understand how lifestyle choices impact academic performance and stress levels.

## 🔍 Objective
To identify patterns and insights from student lifestyle data — including study habits, physical activity, sleep, and socializing — and their relationship with GPA and stress levels.

## 📈 Key Findings

### Academic Performance
- **Study time** is the most influential factor positively associated with higher GPAs.
- **Physical activity** shows a slight positive correlation with GPA.
- **Sleep and socializing** have minimal direct influence on academic outcomes.

### Stress Levels
- No conclusive link between **stress** and **socializing** or **physical activity**.
- Suggests other factors (e.g., coping mechanisms, support systems) play a larger role.

### Combined Observations
- High **study time** + low **physical activity** + variable **sleep** = highest average GPAs.
- Students who study **less** generally have **lower** GPAs regardless of other factors.
